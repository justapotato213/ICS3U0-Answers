    <li>
      Network card recieves information about the shipping label.
    </li>
    <li>
      The network card decodes information into information useful to the PC. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Network card sends data to the motherboard South Bridge via <abbr title="Peripheral Component Interconnect Express">PCIe</abbr>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Southbridge sends an interupt signal to the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> and sends information to the North Bridge, then to the CPU's cache. (Very fast memory, but very small in size, located within the CPU)
    </li>
    <li>
      The <abbr title="Arithmetic logic unit">ALU</abbr> processes the information, being able to use logic gates and arithmetic to create a certain output. (It processes things every clock tick, and clock rate determines how fast the clock tick is.)
    </li>
    <li>
      The ALU sends the output to the Memory Management Unit. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <abbr title"Memory Mangement Unit">The MMU</abbr> sends the output into RAM from cache, translating the virtual memory address sent from the CPU, and sends it to a physical space in RAM.
    </li>
    <li>
      The CPU then tells the RAM to move it to non-volatile storage.
    </li>
    <li>
      The RAM communicates with the North bridge to move information to the non-volatile storage.
    </li>
    <li>
      The North Bridge sends the information to the South Bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      The South Bridge sends the information over the <abbr title="Serial Advanced Technology Attachment">SATA</abbr> cable to the storage.
    </li>
    <li>
      The storage reads the information, and its own controller tells it to store it in a certain area.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> tells the CPU to print the new information via an interrupt signal. 
    </li>
    <li>
      The MMU tells the RAM to move the information from the disk into RAM.
    </li>
    <li>
      The RAM communicates with the North Bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      The North Bridge communicates with the South Bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      The South Bridge communicates with the storage to find the information.
    </li>
    <li>
      The storage controller finds the information, and sends it to the South Bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      The South Bridge sends the information to the North Bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      The North Bridge sends the information into RAM.
    </li>
    <li>
      The MMU moves the information from the RAM into the cache.
    </li>
    <li>
      The CPU with the ALU specifically combines this information as well as the information about the printer to send to the network card.
    </li>
    <li>
      The CPU sends information to the South Bridge on the motherboard.
    </li>
    <li>
      Southbridge processes the information to send to the network card.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Southbridge sends the information over PCIe to the network card.
    </li>
    <li>
      The network card recieves the information and decodes it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The network cards finds the address it is looking for on the network.
    </li>
    <li>
      The network card encodes the information, and sends it as packets over the network to the printer.
    </li>
  </ol>
